    <p>
      I am a passionate learner. For as long as I can remember, 
      from practicing yo-yo tricks to teaching myself Japanese, 
      I've always loved learning new things and developing new skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, I am passionate about the web, and am determined 
      to become the best developer I can be. I am confident that my
      skills with frontend and backend technologies, and more importantly,
      my ability to quickly pick up new skills, would make me a strong 
      addition to any developer team.
